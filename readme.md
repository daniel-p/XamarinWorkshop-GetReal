## Getting real with Xamarin. What does it take to go cross-platform?

Not a lot has been known for this mystical creature called Xamarin but we are going to catch one in the wild, observe, and explore its feeding and living habits and gain a better understanding of why it is so important for the ecosystem.

#### Objective
In this workshop we are going to build an instant messaging app for Android and iOS using a real-time database. During this process we are going to learn more about the following:

- What we need to get started
- How the Xamarin platform works
- Basic Xamarin app architecture
- Sharing code between platforms
- And more!
